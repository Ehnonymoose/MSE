Building requires the following packages:
 - hunspell development files ( >= 1.3.0 )
 - boost development files ( >= 1.37.0 )
 - wxWidgets development files
 - the autoconf archive
 - autotools

To get all of these on Fedora 24, call:

    $ sudo dnf install hunspell-devel boost-devel wxGTK-devel autoconf-archive

After those packages are installed, you should be able to build using the following:

    $ ./MakeAM.sh
    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make -j4
    $ sudo make install

Before running MSE2, we need to set up some data files:

    $ ./Resources.sh

Now things should work:

    $ magicseteditor
