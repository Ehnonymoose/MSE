# MSE Redux

[Magic Set Editor](http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/) is an awesome tool for people interested in designing custom cards for Magic: the Gathering and other TCGs.  Unfortunately, it's grown quite old and was abandoned by its developers years ago -- it doesn't even build on non-Windows systems!

This is an attempt to update MSE to bring it into the modern world.

Specific goals:
 - Fix issues preventing it from building and working on macOS and Linux
 - Update obsolete code and general cleanup
 - Get things to a stage where new features can be added (for the first time in years!)
